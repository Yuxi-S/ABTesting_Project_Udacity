# Experiment Description

At the time of the experiment described herein, the Udacity course home pages have two options: "start free trial" and "access course materials." Clicking "start free trial" prompts the user to enter their credit card information, subsequently enrolling them in a 14 day free trial of the course, after which they are automatically charged. Users who click "access course materials" will be able to view course content but receive no coaching support, verified certificate, or project feedback.

The rationale for this change is that diverting students as a function of time to devote to study might improve the overall student expereince and the coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course, without significantly reducing the number of students who continue past the free trial.
